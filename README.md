# DADM
##### Density-Aware Diffusion Model for Efficient Image Dehazing

### 1. Our Result comparison with other methods.

> Guided by the haze density, our DADM can handle images with dense haze and complex environments.

### 2. Overview of our DADM. 

> * For image dehazing, the haze image can be considered as noisy data, while the clear haze-free image is the target data. By training a diffusion model, we can learn a mapping from haze images to haze-free images. The diffusion model contains a forward diffusion process and a reverse diffusion process.
> * In the reverse diffusion process of our DADM, we introduce a density-aware dehazing network (DADNet) to estimate the noise in the input image and recover a haze-free image from a haze image (considered as a noisy state).

### 3. The haze density of the mage.

> The dark channel value of noise areas is also very low, resulting in the inability to extract accurate haze density information. We introduce a cross-feature density extraction module (CDEModule) to optimize the dark channel map and obtain the accurate haze density for the image.

#### 4. Analysis of the test sampling process on four datasets.

>  The dehazing results have achieved an optimum at some intermediate time point, while the image quality may instead degrade as the dehazing process continues.

### 5. Statistics on Datasets.

> we evaluate all the sampling results at various time steps using the PSNR values against the ground truth.

#### 6. Sampling process for testing.

> We use t1 as the dividing time point. t > $t_1$ is the first stage, while t â‰¤ $t_1$ is the second stage. These two stages use different sampling methods.

#### 7. Analysis of xt on four datasets.

> We evaluate the PSNR vaules between $x_t$ and ground-truth for each time step on four datasets.

#### 8. Visual Comparison with IR-SDE.

> We compared our methods with IR-SDE.
